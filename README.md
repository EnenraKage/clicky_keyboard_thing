# clicky_keyboard_thing
i made this thing ages ago because i couldn't afford a mechanical keyboard lol, thought i'd put it here for archive purposes.

also this requires pynput and winsound packages for python, so install those in the python pip install thingy
google it if you don't know what i'm talking about amigo, anyway i don't even know who would find this or even want to try and download it lol
